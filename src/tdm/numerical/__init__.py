Modules that perform numerical computations.
    - :mod:`2d_dynamics.py` contains logic related to 2d phase portraits,
        such as computing nullclines, fixed points and analyzing fixed point stability.
    - :mod:`shape_intersections.py` contains code for computing spatial intersections of geometric shapes.
        Primarily used for inferring the fraction of each cell's neighborhood that is visible.
